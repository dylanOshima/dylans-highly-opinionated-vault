# Dylan's Highly Opinionated Vault

> WARNING: This is still a WIP. I haven't documented all the small things that I have added to make my life easier, nor have I tested it so that I know that it will work on a fresh start. **USE WITH CAUTION** (though the worse that can happen is that it just doesn't work and you'll have to fix it).

## How to use

1. Download [this repo](https://github.com/dylanOshima/dylans-highly-opinionated-vault/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Open it in Obsidian
3. Click "Trust this vault and enable all plugins"
4. Restart Obsidian
5. Voila!

## Problems
*Feel free to ping me if there are any issues with the vault!*
